### Analysis Team

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy. My research focuses on understanding how humans learn and perceive language, and what the underlying cognitive mechanisms are. At SISSA, I am working with prof. Davide Crepaldi, focussing on the neural mechanisms of statistical learning and reading. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cogntition, and Behaviour/Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, working with prof. James McQueen, dr. Hans Rutger Bosker, & dr. Ashley Lewis. Here I investigated how people deal with between-talker variability in prosody.
