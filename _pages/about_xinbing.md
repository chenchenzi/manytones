I’m Xinbing Luo, a PhD candidate in the Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on the implicit learning of tonal phonology. I’m also involved in ProsodAI, a lab project exploring the neural encoding of AI-generated speech prosody. Before my PhD, I obtained an MPhil degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Distinction) from University of Cambridge and completed a text-to-speech (TTS) internship at ByteDance.
