### Outreach Lead

My research interests lie within speech acoustics and coarticulation. My research spans areas within acoustic phonetics, computational phonology, and natural language processing. Within the _Speech Dynamics Laboratory (SpeeDyLab)_ at Jadavpur University, we are interested in articulatory imaging and modeling, and understanding how the dynamics of speech production and perception systems seamlessly integrate within a unified embodied cognition framework. With paradigms ranging from Ultrasound imaging, computational modeling, and eye-tracking, The SpeeDylab is focussed on uncovering links between speech production and perception, and learning how these links provide insight into reading-related complexities.
