## **Efthymia Kapnoula**

### Method Team

I am an Ikerbasque Research Fellow (tenure-track) and Associate Leader of the Spoken Language group at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, Spain. I received my PhD in Psychology from the University of Iowa, USA. My research examines the fundamental processes and representations that subserve language use, focusing on speech perception, word recognition, and word learning. A big part of my work examines individual differences in how listeners categorize speech sounds. My current interests revolve around the role of experience in shaping language across the lifespan. In terms of methods, I use mainly experimental behavioral, eye-tracking, and electrophysiological (EEG) paradigms. For more information, visit my [personal website](http://effiekapnoula.com/).
