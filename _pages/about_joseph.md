I am an Associate Professor of Spanish Linguistics in the Spanish and Portuguese Department and Associate Faculty in the Department of Linguistics at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. My main interests are in phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second language acquisition. A principle aim of my research is to better understand the relationship between language use and sound representation in the multilingual mind, as well as the structure of sound systems in human languages. Most of my research is conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and linguistic experience. Some of my recent projects have centered on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. I also focus my attention on coding, statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research, as well as training researchers to implement open research practices in the speech sciences, particularly in Bilingualism/Second Language Acquisition research. I also enjoy playing music, Casio watches and anything related to el andal√∫.
