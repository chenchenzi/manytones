### Analysis Lead

I'm a cognitive scientist with a focus on human speech. My research interests centre around the question of how multi-dimensional, continuous aspects of speech can be related to discrete behavioural observations and cognitive representations. To get there, I research how the speech signal is encoded during speech production, how and when aspects of it are retrieved during speech perception and processing, and how language users learn and generalise learned sound patterns. One common methodological theme that runs throughout my work is the critical assessment of experimental design and a strong commitment to quantitative methods, statistical models and open science. I'm also a strong proponent of diversifying the languages, participants, researchers, and projects represented in the language sciences. As the chair of the ManyLanguages consortium, I try to help with that. For more information, visit my personal [website](https://timo-b-roettger.github.io).
