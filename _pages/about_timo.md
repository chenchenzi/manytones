## **Timo B. Roettger**

### Analysis Lead

I'm a cognitive scientist with a focus on human speech. My research interests centre around how multi-dimensional, continuous aspects of speech relate to discrete behavioural observations and cognitive representations. I research how the speech signal is encoded during speech production, how and when aspects of it are retrieved during speech perception and processing, and how language users learn and generalise learned sound patterns. One methodological theme throughout my work is the critical assessment of experimental design and a strong commitment to quantitative methods, statistical models and open science. As the chair of the ManyLanguages consortium, I'm a strong proponent of diversifying the languages, participants, and researchers represented in the language sciences.
