I'm an Associate Professor in Phonetics and Cognitive Systems in the Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia, and the director of the OoPS-Lab (Origins of Patterns in Speech Lab). My research focuses mainly on the emergence and maintenance of systematic patterns in speech, where patterns are understood in a broad sense. They include not only conventional phonological and morphological patterns, but also: relationships between communicative function / language use / meaning on the one hand and the shapes of words on the other; orderly configurations in sound systems; and recurring patterns of change across languages.
