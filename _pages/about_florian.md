### Analysis Team

I am a Professor in the Departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Computer Science, and Linguistics, at the University of Rochester. I am an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow in the Neurosciences, and NSF CAREER recipient in Robust Intelligence. My research focuses on the development of computational frameworks for language production and understanding. This includes research on the consequences of noise and variability (e.g., between talkers) for communication and the study of inference under uncertainty and learning in production and comprehension. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health. I have served as reviewer for federal funding agencies in the US, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Holland, and the European Union.
