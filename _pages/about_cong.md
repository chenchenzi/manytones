### Ethics Lead

I am a Lecturer in Phonetics and Phonology at Newcastle University, United Kingdom. Previously, I received my doctorate from the University of Oxford and have worked outside academia in developing speech technology products. My research focuses on aspects of speech prosody, such as intonation and lexical tone, with a particular emphasis on their interaction. I employ a range of experimental and computational methods to investigate prosodyâ€™s role in shaping communication. Beyond prosody, I work on improving the phonetics research pipeline, including reliable remote data collection and gamified citizen science approaches. I also bridge linguistic theory with speech technology, contributing to advancements in speech processing and its real-world applications.
