## **Chenzi Xu**

### Scientific Lead

I am a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Oxford. I received my D.Phil. (Ph.D.) in Linguistics from the University of Oxford. Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral research associate in forensic phonetics at the University of York, focusing on person-specific automatic speaker recognition.
My research interests are in phonetics, psychoacoustics, sociophonetics, tone, speech and language technology (particularly with applications to low-resource languages). My recent work investigates the production and perception of tonal patterns across languages, with a perspective to understanding systematic phonetic variation and its implications for linguistic theory.
