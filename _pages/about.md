**ManyTones (MT)** is a collaborative project for investigation, replication and best practices in speech perception research related to the development of tones across many languages. Our goal is to bring researchers together to address outstanding theoretical and methodological questions about the perception of pitch in speech.

**Join ManyTones**

We are expanding the ManyTones team!

ManyTones is supported by ManyLanguages. We use the [Canvas](https://canvas.psysciacc.org/) system to communicate with team members and track research progress. To register for our membership website, please visit https://member.psysciacc.org/. You can register for the Psychological Science Accelerator and/or ManyLanguages, as we use the same Canvas system to communicate with members and track studies.
