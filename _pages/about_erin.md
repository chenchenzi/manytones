### **Erin M. Buchanan**

### Data Lead

Dr. Erin M. Buchanan received her Ph.D. from Texas Tech University in computational linguistics with a focus on statistics after attending Texas A&M University for her undergraduate degree. In her spare time, she likes to watch sports, play video games, go to National Parks, and travel the globe.

Dr. Erin M. Buchananâ€™s research focuses on modeling semantic memory and the underlying language network by creating better measures of relationships between concepts. She also examines statistical practices and how we can improve those practices through enhanced methodology and teaching (check her out on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/erinbuchanan)!). Last, she collaborates with other investigators to improve their statistics and develop psychometrically sound measures of their concepts.
