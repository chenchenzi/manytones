## **Erin M. Buchanan**

### Data Lead

I am a Professor of Cognitive Analytics at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. I received my Ph.D. from Texas Tech University in computational linguistics with a focus on statistics after attending Texas A&M University for my undergraduate degree. In my spare time, I like to watch sports, play video games, go to National Parks, and travel the globe. My research focuses on modeling semantic memory and the underlying language network by creating better measures of relationships between concepts. I also examine statistical practices and how we can improve those practices through enhanced methodology and teaching. Last, I collaborate with other investigators to improve their statistics and develop psychometrically sound measures of their concepts.
